            "Selecting the studies Selecting the studies First, how were the studies selected? We used the Medline database and retrieved all the records mentioning (1) myelin, (2) MRI and (3) histology (or a related technique). The full list of keywords is provided in the preprint. The following Sankey diagram shows the screening process: you can hover with the mouse on each block and connection to see details about the number of studies and exclusion criteria. import numpy as np import pandas as pd import plotly.graph_objects as go from IPython.core.display import display, HTML from plotly.offline import plot import plotly.express as px import...",

            "Brain studies A closer look Given the number of different variables influencing the results, we decided to focus only on brain studies. As we needed to take into account the sample size for quantitative comparisons, we also further selected only the studies that reported both the number of subjects and the number of ROIs (regions of interest) considered for correlation purposes. This further screening led us to 43 studies. For these studies we wanted to quantitatively evaluate the reported effect size taking into account the respective samples sizes: we chose the coefficient of determination R2, as it was the most...",

This is where the meta-analysis tools come in: we used the R package metafor to fit a mixed-effect (ME) model to the data reported for each measure. In this way, we can estimate an overall interval of R2 values based on the effect sizes and the sample sizes. We can also estimate the interval of R2 that we can expect in future studies (this is called prediction interval). A compact way to represent these results is given by forest plots: for each...",

Focusing specifically on myelin measures, we show the results of our meta-analysis comparing quantitative MRI with histology. The full preprint is available on bioRxiv. Why myelin? Myelin is a key component of the central nervous system. The myelin sheaths insulate axons with a triple effect: allowing fast electrical conduction, protecting the axon, and providing trophic support. The conduction velocity regulation has become an important research topic, with evidence of activity-dependent myelination as an additional...",
